# overlay 2realities

This is an overlay where I maintain some gentoo ebuilds used by me.

This overlay isn't yet in the layman remote list, so to add it manually via layman do this

    layman -o https://raw.github.com/artem-sidorenko/portage-2realities/master/metadata/2realities.xml -f -a 2realities
